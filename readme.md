# SomeAgents - AI Agent Project Collection

This repository contains a collection of AI Agent projects I've created. Each project is located in its own subdirectory and is independent.

## Global Dependency Management

This project collection uses [uv](https://astral.sh/uv) as its package installation and virtual environment management tool. `uv` provides a fast and reliable dependency resolution.

### Install uv

If you haven't installed `uv` yet, you can install it using `pip` or `brew` (macOS):

```bash
pip install uv

# Or for macOS:
brew install uv
```

## How to Use

Please navigate to the subdirectory of the project you are interested in and refer to its corresponding `README.md` file for detailed installation and usage instructions. Each sub-project will guide you on how to use `uv` to install its specific dependencies.
